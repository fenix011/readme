## Hi, I am a web maker
> Also a SysOps and "FLOSSer" by heart

I'm a Senior Software Engineer working in collaboration for little great agency in Amsterdam. I build a lot of projects for fun with HTML5, Jekyll, Hugo... and more. A big fan of elegant designs, clean code, and static site generators.

### Tools and skills ðŸŽ“

Python is my first love and preferred language - see my [Python repos on GitHub](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python). 

- Backend (render HTML and build REST APIs)
- Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Python packages (Requests, BeatifoulSoup, and more...)
- Shell scripting (GNU / Linux)
- Architect and build systems and networks  infrastructure (using DebOps, Ansible, Terraform, DNS, IPtables...)
- Containerized services (Docker and LXC)
- (... and now learning Data Science (web scraping, data visualization, machine learning)
- Write documentation and make documentation sites 

More details on the tools:

### Projects ðŸ’¼

I like to make quickstarts which can be used as templates to make websites, such as with React, Vue, MkDocs, Jekyll or Docsify. See my [quickstart](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin?tab=repositories&q=quickstart&type=&language=) projects on GitHub.

My gists are available on a one-page site - [Gist Viewer](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/gist-viewer/)


### What is this README profile thing? ðŸ¤”

<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
     
This page you are reading is a profile readme. Around July 2020, GitHub made this a public feature.

To make one, create a repo named after your username (matching case exactly) and create a `README.md` file in it. Then go to your GitHub profile and you'll see your README appear there âœ¨.

- I've got inspired by my friend [MichaelCurrin/MichaelCurrin](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/MichaelCurrin/) repo where this README lives
